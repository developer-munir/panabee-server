    "details": "Django—pronounced “Jango,” named after the famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt—is a free, open source framework that was first publicly released in 2005. Django facilitates “rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.” The Django web framework, deployed on a web server, can help developers quickly produce a web frontend that’s feature-rich, secure and scalable.Starting with the Django web framework is more efficient way to build a web app than starting from scratch, which requires building the backend, APIs, javascript and sitemaps. With the Django web framework, web developers can focus on creating a unique application and benefit from greater flexibility than using a web development tool."

As your application grows, Pyramid offers many features that make writing complex software take less effort.Pyramid works in all supported versions of Python. Our installation instructions will help you get Pyramid up and running.Pyramid may be extended through add-ons and development environments. The Python Package Index trove classifier is used by over 470 packages. Support may be by the Pylons Project or  by the community.All projects under the Pylons Project have 100% test coverage and 100% documentation.An  is a package which relies on Pyramid itself and extends the functionality of Pyramid, such as adding an ORM, sending email, or using a template-based language. If your add-on does not rely on Pyramid, it's not an add-on, but just a library, and it will not be listed on the Extending Pyramid page. Official Pylons Project libraries may be listed.a special category of packages which use Pyramid as a core, but offer alternative services and scaffolding to ease web application development. Some could be labeled content management system or admin interface. Development environments often have dependencies beyond those of the Pyramid core."

    "details": "Free open source full-stack framework for rapid development of fast, scalable, secure and portable database-driven web-based applications. Written and programmable in Python (version 3 and 2.7).The best way to understand web2py is to try it. You can try it online here (this online version is identical to the actual web2py although some functions are disabled for security reasons).web2py was inspired by Ruby on Rails and, as Rails, it focuses on rapid development and follows a Model View Controller design. web2py differs from Rails because it is based on Python (thus it is faster and more scalable), because it provides a comprehensive web-based administrative interface (thus there is no need to ever type shell commands unless you wish), includes libraries to handle more protocols (for example XML-RPC and RSS feeds), and can run on the Google App Engine.web2py was also inspired by Django and, as Django, it has the ability to generate forms from database tables and it includes an extensive set of validators. web2py differs from Django because it is more compact, easier to learn and does not have any project-level configuration files.web2py is less verbose than Java-based frameworks and its syntax is much cleaner than PHP-based frameworks. This makes applications simpler to develop, and easier to read and maintain."

Spring framework makes the easy development of JavaEE application.Spring is a lightweight framework. It can be thought of as a framework of frameworks because it provides support to various frameworks such as Struts, Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, etc. The framework, in broader sense, can be defined as a structure where we find solution of the various technical problems.The Spring framework comprises several modules such as IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, ORM, WEB MVC etc. We will learn these modules in next page. Let's understand the IOC and Dependency Injection first."
